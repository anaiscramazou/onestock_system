One type of one-stock system is such with two competing balancing loops; in which two feedback loops are operating simultaneously. For example, Meadows sheds light on the Thermostat model. In this model there is a heating loop, where the thermostat sends a detection to the furnace to warm the room when the room's temperature drops below the thermostat setting. Contrastingly, the second balancing feedback loop is the cooling loop, where heat leaks out of the room; this depends on the quality of the room's insulation. Hence, due to the existence of a draining process (the cooling loop), the stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop needs to acknowledge the existence of the cooling loop and its processes to avoid missing the target for the stock.
